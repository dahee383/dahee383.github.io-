    <h1>
  
      MASK EXPLORATION

    </h1>

    <p>

      This project was an exploration of visualizing non-cathartic emotions into tangible<br>
      and active objects. I explored the concept of a mask not as something used to hide<br>
      one's true identity, but by projecting non-resolvable, hard-to-express emotions onto<br>
      oneself and the mask, it becomes not a use of conealing but a platform for vocalizing 
      and announcing emotions.
